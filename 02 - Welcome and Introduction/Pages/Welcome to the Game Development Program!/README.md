# Welcome to the Game Development Program!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the game arts program. We’re so excited to have you here and what we feel is a very special environment for learning.</span></p>
<p><span>We treat each program like a Boot Camp and one of our guiding principles is that people are&nbsp;<em><strong>over educated and under worked</strong></em>. In essence, we take our educational model from the old atelier in guild systems of the renaissance.</span></p>
<p><span>We are going to be providing lectures and support material and sharing videos with you. However, at the core of your time here is&nbsp;<strong>The Work</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>So we have to talk a little bit about what the work is and what we mean when we say,&nbsp;<strong>The Work</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>For most of your education work is defined as your homework. Homework is built around making sure that you understand the concepts that are being taught. That is not what we mean by “the Work quote.</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, we will be giving you lectures and teaching new concepts. However, we all know artists who have less understanding of software then us but are able to achieve much better results. This is one of the central problems our program was designed to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>Personally, I helped develop ZBrush and I knew that software program in and out but I met artist daily that could do more with the clay brush then I could do with all the other features of ZBrush combined.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the next few weeks, we will explore a wide range of topics that pertain to game development in Unreal Engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an Unreal Authorized Training Center, we will provide a range of up to date curriculum, information and workflows about Unreal Engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please remember that you will need to spend 20+ hours outside of class working on your assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of the program you will gain the skills needed to function as an Unreal Engine generalist and/or and Unreal Engine Technical Artist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will meet twice a week for lectures and demos via GoToMeeting, we will also provide assistance through channels in the Vertex School Discord.</p>
